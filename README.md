# Helpo™
Welcome to the official Helpo™ Github repository! Helpo™ is a voice recognition assistant developed and supported by Dimitrios Vlachos (Github nickname: Apousiologos). Helpo™ is an open-source application developed with pure Android Studio™, inspired by this post: http://code4reference.com/2012/07/tutorial-android-voice-recognition/. Note that I do NOT mention this post for advertisement, but it's fair to note down where I got some inspiration from. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask me in my e-mail. Should you have any ideas for Helpo™'s future, you can add these features WITHOUT my premission. Just send me the final. apk file so as to have the most recent version! 
Head up to "Releases" to get the latest Helpo™.apk
