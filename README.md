# Helpo™
Welcome to the official Helpo™ Github repository! Helpo™ is a voice recognition assistant developed and supported by Dimitrios Vlachos (Github nickname: Apousiologos). Helpo™ is an open-source application developed with pure Android Studio™, inspired by this post: http://code4reference.com/2012/07/tutorial-android-voice-recognition/. Note that I do NOT mention this post for advertisement, but it's fair to note down where I got some inspiration from. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask me in my e-mail. Should you have any ideas for Helpo™'s future, you can add these features WITHOUT my premission. Just send me the final. apk file so as to have the most recent version!
